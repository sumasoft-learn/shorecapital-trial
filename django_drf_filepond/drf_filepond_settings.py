Setup some local application settings with local defaults.
This approach is based on the one shown in this blog post:

******** Settings in this file are not currently being used for core library
******** use due to an issue with dynamically setting up the storage
******** location in the FileSystemStorage class. For now, you must set
******** DJANGO_DRF_FILEPOND_UPLOAD_TMP in your top level app settings.
******** THIS IS CURRENTLY USED ONLY FOR INTEGRATION TESTS
